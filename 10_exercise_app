Aim is to create small e-commerce application:
1) create JPA/hibernate entities for Product, Catalog, User, cart etc..
2) create CRUD DAO methods for the entiries with hibernate/JPA
3) create services/business layer class that exposes all data operations
4) create business methods for managing products, adding to cart and checkout operations..
5) create Unit test classess (either Junit or plan java classes) to test the operations till checkout

Note: make sure to maintain folder structure accordingly for each layer. eg: model/entity, dao, service etc....
